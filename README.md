# Exploratory-data-analysis-on-causes-of-death
This project intends to To identify the most common causes and trends of death in 5 countries-Bangladesh, Colombia, France, 
Somalia and the United States of America and gain insightful information about the unique problems that 
each of these countries face by using the Python programming language for data analysis.
Through the findings of this study, it is hoped that this topic may later be explored even further and to widen 
its scope so as to prevent some of these deaths in the future if possible
